              <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitilize"> I had gone to Legoland in the month of July, in 2021. Legoland is so much fun! It's a great time for the family to enjoy.  The rides aren't too turbulent and the Lego displays are very impressive.  Lots of interactive things to do.  It's a huge place so wear ultra comfortable shoes and it is in the mountains so you may get cold - particularly after September though when I went it was pretty good weather, I reccomend checking the weather before planning to go.  My family and I went and they had a blast. I truly reccomend going to legoland.

                Coastal flooding will increase significantly over the next 30 years because of sea level rise, according to a new report by an interagency sea level rise task force that includes NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and other federal agencies. Titled Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States, the Feb. 15 report concludes that sea level along U.S. coastlines will rise between 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) on average above today’s levels by 2050. The report – an update to a 2017 report – forecasts sea level to the year 2150 and, for the first time, offers near-term projections for the next 30 years. Agencies at the federal, state, and local levels use these reports to inform their plans on anticipating and coping with the effects of sea level rise.

                “This report supports previous studies and confirms what we have long known: Sea levels are continuing to rise at an alarming rate, endangering communities around the world. Science is indisputable and urgent action is required to mitigate a climate crisis that is well underway,” said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. “NASA is steadfast in our commitment to protecting our home planet by expanding our monitoring capabilities and continuing to ensure our climate data is not only accessible but understandable.”

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12"> NASA will launch four Earth science missions in 2022 to provide scientists with more information about fundamental climate systems and processes, including extreme storms, surface water and ocean, and atmospheric dust. Scientists will discuss the upcoming missions at the American Geophysical Union’s (AGU) 2021 Fall Meeting, hosted in New Orleans between Dec. 13 and 17.

            NASA has a unique view of our planet from space. NASA’s fleet of Earth-observing satellites provide high-quality data on Earth’s interconnected environment, from air quality to sea ice. NASA’s TROPICS mission aims to improve observations of tropical cyclones. Six TROPICS satellites will work in concert to provide microwave observations of a storm's precipitation, temperature, and humidity as quickly as every 50 minutes. Scientists expect the data will help them understand the factors driving tropical cyclone intensification and will contribute to weather forecasting models.

       <p> Percy Jackson and the lightning theif is a great movie to watch with friends or family, Though the monsters they use are really disgusting looking and is not reccomended for kids below age of 9. However the movie has good graphics and is not as voilent as some poeple think it is. In fact is is a 0.9 voilent out of 10 so it's below even 1%. I reccomend you watch this movie and all the other movies in the series. Hope you like the movie! </p>
